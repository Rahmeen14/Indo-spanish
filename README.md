## A multicultural, collaborative project focussed on learning Arduino.

This project was carried out under the guidance of Dr. Pinaki Chakraborthy (from NSIT, Delhi) and Dr. Christina (from URJC, Madrid). 

A delegation of 6 people from NSIT collaborated with a team of students from URJC, Madrid (Rey Juan Carlos University). Our final project was building a Domotic Home Automation System.

We used the online IDE Autodesk Tinkercad for simulations of circuits.
The final project was created after three phases of collaboration, focussed on learning.

The final project includes five independent functional parts. The parts are listed below along with a brief description of their working:

## 1. Smart Lighting system: 

In this project, we will show you how to switch a light on or off depending on
exterior light levels, with an Arduino board and some components. This will be
achieved by using a photocell sensor, which is a basically a light-dependent resistor.

## 2. Gas Sensor Arduino Shield

In this project, we show how to light different LEDs according to level of
gas. In case of high level of gas, all the LEDs light up indicating a
possible fire/gas leak in the house.

## 3. Temperature Sensor

In this project, a temperature rise above 45 degree celcius is detected by
means of a temperature sensor and indicated by a buzzer.

## 4. Fan Speed Automation Control

In this project, a temperature sensor is used to detect the current
temperature and the speed of the fan is controlled accordingly.

## 5. Anti-Theft Alarm

This is a circuit that use the PIR or Passive Infrared Sensor to detect
motion. Whenever motion is detected an alarm ( a series of musical
notes ) is played by the circuit.
